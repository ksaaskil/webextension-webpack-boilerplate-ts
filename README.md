# Webextension webpack boilerplate with TypeScript

Boilerplate for building webextensions for Chrome and Firefox using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Adapted from [chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate) with the added features:

- Support for TypeScript
- Inclusion of [webextension-polyfill-ts](https://github.com/Lusito/webextension-polyfill-ts) for accessing browser APIs via [webextension-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill)
- Refactored webpack configuration for separate development and production configurations
